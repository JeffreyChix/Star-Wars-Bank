_Have fun searching and navigating all the Star Wars Data you've ever wanted_

## What is `Star Wars Bank`?

Having troubles with finding star wars data online? Star Wars Bank is here to help. It is a beginner-friendly web application that pulls all the star wars data from 1977, the first film release date and formats them into human readable information which is fun to use. It is based on the popular Star Wars API => [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev) and was designed to help you grasp and understand modern web technologies if you are a beginner.

## What are the technologies used?

Star Wars Bank is an open-source project which means you are allowed to clone it, fix issues and add new features as much as you can. It was developed with [React](https://react.org) - a popular Javascript library developed by Facebook for building highly scalable user interfaces.

Star Wars Bank uses the popular Star Wars API which you can find @ [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev). It has no backend but that's feature you can add. It's up to you to come up with new ideas. It is currently deployed on Netlify with the continous deployment approach.

## What can I use it for?

This app was designed for beginners who are new to React Development and advanced developers who just want to have some fun working on open-source projects. 

React is one of the most used, popular Javascript libraries which popular successful companies like Facebook and Netlflix are making use of. If you are thinking of adding a new skill to your list, you should go for React if you haven't already. Now, React can be a bit intimidating at first but I suggest adopting the project-based learning approach which is why I made Star Wars Bank to help you get started. 

#### `Just replicating this project can raise your React skills to 60%!`

## How do I get started?

It's simple. You are allowed to fork or clone this repository and experiment with it, add new features, fix bugs or use it as a building block to your own unique project.

### Download and install all dependencies
Run `npm install` or `yarn add` to install all dependencies. I suggest you make a clean installation.

### Understand the folder structure
The `public` folder contains some basic files like the index.html file. You won't touch this folder 80% of your time working on this project.

Inside the `src` folder, you will find four sub-folders: 
1. Assets:
This is where you will find or place assets like images used in the application. Keep it simple and light.
2. Components
The components folder is loaded up with two sub-folders: 
    * pages => all the pages accessible by users and their corresponding stylesheets
    * UI => reusable UI components like Buttons and Modals
3. ErrorBoundary
This is where the file that handles all generic errors lie. It is a class based component.
4. Hooks
This project uses custom hooks and you can find all the custom hooks used in this folder.
